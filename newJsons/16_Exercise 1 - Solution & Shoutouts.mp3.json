Let's roll the intro. \ud83c\udfb6 Music \ud83c\udfb6 So guys, I have come to my computer screen. And the first thing I will do is make a folder named video 16. So I will write here video 16. And after opening it, right click on it and open with code. And after doing this, I will make a boilerplate template here. Today we are going to do a little special work because today we will get a shoutout to everyone. So first of all, if you have not accessed the playlist, then do access it. Now I am going to open this video here. So I opened this video in which I had given you exercise. And this exercise was about a pure HTML media player. Okay, so I told you to make a media player in this. And here I will sort by new as first. And I will come down completely. And after coming down completely, what I will do here is that I will give a shoutout to all the people who have solved it. So guys, I have scrolled all the way down. It took me a long time to scroll, to be honest. I will give a shoutout to everyone. But before that, I want to solve this question for you. So here you can see 1.mp3, 1.mp4, 2.mp3, all the way till 5.mp3. So what I will do first is I will put an h1. My videos for the day. Okay, I will write h1 here. And here I will write some audios for the day. Okay, I do my videos and audios for the day. What I will do here is that I will toggle the screencast mode. Because it looks a little easy to you. And here some videos. So I wrote an h1 and here I put an h2. And here I will simply put videos in a div. So as soon as I write the video tag here And after that I will write the controls here. So I will actually be able to watch this 1.mp4. What I will do simply is that I will press the shift, alt and down arrow. And here I will write 2, then I will write 3, then I will write 4. And then I will write 5. And I will do the same thing for audio as well. And here I will write audio. And here I will write 1.mp3. And after that I will write controls. Okay, and after that I will do the same thing. And I will replicate it 5 times. I did 2, 3, 4. And here I will do 5. And obviously I will try to show you by previewing it here. Now there is a problem here. And the problem is that it is taking the full width. So it is becoming very problematic for me. Maybe because I am zoomed in. Okay, so it is not becoming problematic. Otherwise we would have reset it with CSS. But for now I think we are good. We will see how to resize it in CSS. How things can be improved. But I think our videos have come here. And some audios for the day have also come. So you can see the audios. And if you guys are playing songs. So songs will come. I have not put songs. You can see my videos are playing. Give me something to eat. And these are the videos. This is a jihad. But to see it, a person needs to be very strict. And this is my personal favorite. Chaaab, Orenal. So you guys must have put your favorite videos. But that was pretty much about it. And many people are saying that it is very easy. This exercise was so simple. Remember my words. What is left? Now we give shoutout. Shoutout to Soumya172. Shoutout to Code with Rohit. Who accepted the challenge. Here Multiatmos, Desi Reddy, Shantop, Harsh Gularia.

And here I will give shoutout to those who have solved. I will give shoutout to those who have solved. Has anyone solved? I will see even replies. Has anyone solved? No one has solved yet. Has anyone solved? No one has solved. Not yet. Okay, so Coder Anderson. Congratulations to you. You have won 7 crore rupees. You have used tables for the first time. Which is fine. The thing is that tables are not ideally used. To be honest. To do such work. But I think we are good. From 1 to 6, he has shown videos. He has given width and height in the video. Which is a great thing. Actually, I will do it in my video. In fact, I will write. Width is equal to 239. Let's see how it changes. It is looking better. Why didn't I think of this idea? When I was solving. Coder Anderson. Shoutout to you. Shoutout to you. Now who has solved the next one? Saif0981. Shoutout to him too. You have solved beautifully. Very good. Very good. Shoutout to CzarMorty. And shoutout to Jheel Maheshwari. I want to say one thing. Many of you have not solved it. This was not the participation. I wanted more participation.
