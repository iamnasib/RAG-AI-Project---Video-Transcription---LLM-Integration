    "text": " In this video, we will see how to add CSS to an HTML page. There are three ways to add CSS to HTML. The first way is inline CSS which is used as a style attribute and added to HTML pages. The second way is internal CSS. Internal CSS means to put a style tag and put the CSS of that HTML in the style tag of the HTML page. And after that, the most used is external CSS. Make a .css file and put all your styles in that .css file. In this video, I will tell you very closely what is the difference between the three, when to use and when to avoid. I am very excited. Do like this video and don't forget to write Sigma patch op in the comment section below. Let's go to the computer screen. Let's roll the intro. So I told you three ways to add CSS to any HTML page. The first thing I will do is to make a folder named video15. I will open it by right-clicking and I will make an index.html and put a boilerplate template. If you have not accessed the playlist, then you can access it. It is very important to access the playlist. Now I will come back to my video15 HTML code. Let's say we have a basic HTML. I wrote here I am a good boy. And after that, let's say I put an h1 here and I wrote about me. And here I put in the div I am a good boy. Let's say I put a paragraph too. Everyone is good in some way or the other. Does this even make any sense? Let's say I put this. Here I will click on the view and toggle word wrap. I will not shift right click, I will right click and toggle screencast mode. You listen to me carefully. Look, if I have to style it here, then there is a very short cut method. Which I also call the desi way. I mean, I have a very quick and dirty way. That I will put a style tag here. First of all, let's preview it and see how it looks. So this is how it looks. I have zoomed in to show you, but you will see it like this. Which is fine. But I am showing you by zooming in so that you can see. Now what is written in about, let's say I want to make its background yellow. And I want to make its font red. For some weird reason. Let's do it. So what I have in a very quick and dirty way. That I will put a style attribute here. After this, I will write color here. And I will write yellow here. And you see VS Code is helping me completely. It is fully supporting me in writing. Whatever I am thinking, it is giving me an auto-complete. And that's one of the reasons we are using VS Code. If you go to any website or any IDE, then you get this kind of support. This is the reason we don't code in notepad. In the starting, many people asked me questions. Why don't we do it in notepad? What is there in this that is not in notepad? So this is fine. Now let's say I want to add another property. First I will show that this property has been applied. Now see its color has become yellow. Now let's say I want to make its background red. Background color red. Fine. And here the background will also turn red. So whatever I want to do with the help of CSS, I can do it. I want to add those things in individual elements. So I can do that. Now this is not considered a good practice. It is not considered a good practice. Why it is not considered? I will tell you in a while. But I will tell you two more ways. Adding CSS to a webpage. I do one thing. I do one thing. I will write the title of this. Three ways to add CSS to HTML. Fine. So our first method which I have written. I do one thing. I use div here. I will use ordered list. I will use ol. Fine. And I will write a list item. And I am going to write here. The first method is inline CSS. Fine. So I told you about inline CSS. This is called inline CSS. That by holding any element, What will happen to writing CSS in style attribute? That CSS will be applied in that element. This will happen. So till now we have read about inline CSS. First method. Now I will tell you the second method. Here I will write li. The second method is internal CSS. Fine. So the second method says that you don't do like this. Fine. I will replicate this. And I will remove this style attribute. We will say don't do like this. Write a style tag. Fine. Listen carefully. Don't get confused. Listen to me very carefully. Put a style tag here in the head after the title. And write your selector and declaration here. Fine. So what is our selector? H1. I will say what to do with all H1 of this page? Make its background yellow. And make its color red. Fine. I think I had made the color yellow earlier. So I make the color yellow and background red. Fine. Make the color yellow and background red. That's it. I made the color yellow and background red. It will still be the same as before. But how is this different from inline CSS? Inline CSS, I have to add style to every element. You guys understand. If there is 100 H1 on my page, then I can do this automatically. But here I have to do style is equal to style is equal to style is equal to style is equal to again and again. So I don't want to do it again and again. Okay, let's say I did it again and again. I also put style is equal to in every element. Now let's say I have to change. For some reason, my boss told me that in our production website, the background color should be marooned. So what will I do? Will I maroon all the elements one by one? Instead of red? No. I want to bulk edit. And if I am using internal CSS and not using inline CSS, then I can bulk edit. What do I have to do? I have to maroon one place instead of red. And all the H1 of my page will be marooned. But if I have written style is equal to style is equal to style is equal to style is equal to in every element individually, then I will have to find all those elements first. After that, I will have to do it individually in all of them. So that's why inline CSS is not used as much. But you should know what inline CSS is. Why is it? How can you use it? You will do internal or the most used one. External CSS. I will tell you about it. Now the idea of external CSS is that if you are writing internal CSS, then your style tag will keep growing. Suppose I am writing CSS here and there, then your HTML file will keep growing. So why don't we write the CSS here in a file? This is the idea of external CSS. Whatever you are writing here, don't write here. Write in a file. So we will use a link tag. If I write colon CSS, then this shortcut will come here. So I am saying that I have written my CSS in style.css. What have I done? I have written my CSS in style.css. Go and see there. Okay? I have done something like this. Okay? So here I show you that I can write style.css like this. And as soon as I write style.css here, and I will put these styles in it. Now I show you that styles have been removed from my page. By the way, no background is red, nothing is yellow. But as soon as I add here, then this style.css, I have linked it here. So what does link tag do? Link says that link style.css as a style sheet. So what will happen? This CSS will be added to my page. It's as simple as that. Okay? I hope you have understood all this. And you must have understood this thing very clearly that what is the difference between inline CSS, internal CSS, and external CSS. Now I tell you which one you should use. See, you should not use inline CSS at all. Okay? I am saying, try not to use inline CSS in ideal scenarios. But if inline CSS is automatically generated, about which I will tell you later. Now don't be confused. Now as a beginner, you understand that you should use inline CSS at least. In fact, you have to avoid it. Okay? You will use internal CSS only when your web page is very small and you just want to write CSS very lightly. Like I tell you a very good use case to use internal CSS. When I used to write websites in bootstrap, then in my website, all the styling was done by bootstrap. But sometimes I had to make light tweaks. Then I used internal CSS. You will use external CSS only when you are making a big production website. And in most of the cases, if you are working on a serious project, you must be making a production grade website. And if you are making a production grade website, then you will want to use best practices in it. And using external style sheet is considered a good practice. Why? Because you can detach a style sheet from an HTML, you can also attach it. You can tell your colleagues that you work on a style sheet, I work on HTML. You write styles, I am working on HTML. So you can work very well parallelly. These things become very easy if you use external style sheet. And in most of the cases, in any kind of production grade project, big websites that have been written, whether it is Netflix, YouTube, or Quora, or Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Web, whatever. In most of the cases, you will get external style sheets in all these websites. So let me make a revision of you. Inline CSS means that you wrote CSS by putting a style tag in the element. Internal CSS means that you wrote CSS by putting a style tag. And external CSS means that you made a style.css or any file named name.css and linked it to a CSS file. I hope you have understood the difference between the three. And I know that I am going a little slower because many people are beginners in this course. I am telling you again, we are going to raise the bar like anything. We are going to make very dangerous production grade websites in the coming videos. So you guys will be excited. Do let me know in the comment section below. Now if you have not accessed this playlist here, then do access it. I will keep updating everything in the source code. Don't worry about it. That's all for now in this video, guys. Thank you so much guys for watching this video. And I will see you next time. Music."
