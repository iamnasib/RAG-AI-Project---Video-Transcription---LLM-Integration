Now, what kind of elements can we apply style on and how can we select those elements?  For example, element with an id, element with a class, we can target the element by its name.  And we can also decide that if there is a particular type of element in a particular type of element, then only the styling should be applied.  I will explain the rules of applying styling in this video and will explain selectors to you."

    "text": " Guys, we talked about selectors in CSS and we said that selectors are used to select an element on which style is going to be applied. Now, what kind of elements can we apply style on and how can we select those elements? For example, element with an id, element with a class, we can target the element by its name. And we can also decide that if there is a particular type of element in a particular type of element, then only the styling should be applied. I will explain the rules of applying styling in this video and will explain selectors to you. If you are enjoying this course, then do write sigma patch op in the comment section below. We have to maintain high energy throughout the course. I want to give you a heads up that this video is very important. This is a very important video of CSS. So increase your excitement. Let's go to the computer screen. Let's roll the intro. Alright guys, so I have come to my computer screen and the first thing I am going to do is to make a folder of video 17. And video 17 is one of the most important videos of CSS. Because if you understand how selectors work, then your work will be very easy. So I will make it here with the name video 17. I will make it here and I am going to use the internal CSS here. I will not make a style sheet. So that you can see how I am doing whatever I am doing. And here I will do a lot of things. I will turn on Word Wrap, I will turn on Screencast Mode so that you can know whatever button I press. And I will write CSS selectors here. And I will make a div here. And I made a simple div here. I wrote I am a div here. Guys, if you have not accessed it yet, then do play the playlist of Sigma Web Development. And the source code is getting updated. So you should not have any tension in that regard. Now what I am going to do here is a very simple thing. I will preview it first. And I want to make the background of this div red. Now you will say why do you want to make the background of this div red? Because I want to know how much space this div is taking. That's why I want to make it red. So I want to make it red. So I will simply give the background here red. So I will put a style tag here. I will say that the background of the div should be red. Now this is our property, this is the value. I will tell you more about the property and value. But for now, you understand that this is the property and this is the value. So what I did here was the element selector. I will write element selector here. And I will comment it here. In CSS, comments are written like this. Here forward slash star and then star forward slash. Whatever we write in the middle of the slash, those are comments in CSS. So I put a CSS comment that this is an element selector. You will see here that the background of this div has become red. This was our element selector, a very basic selector. Now what are the drawbacks of the element selector that I made here? The drawbacks are that the moment I add another div here. So what will happen? The background of this div will also become red. And it is possible that you do not want to make the background of this div red. So if you do not want to make the background of this div red, then what will you do? Definitely you will use some other type of selector here. And you will want to use a specific selector. So I can say that do one thing, where the class is red, only that div should be red. So I made class is equal to red here. Now because I have made class is equal to red here, you will see here what? If I write here dot red and after doing dot red, if I make the background color red. Suppose I comment this out, I do not want all the divs to be red. So I show you here that only this div will be red. As you can see here. So that's why I used the class selector here. So this is our class selector. I write here class selector. After this, the next selector I am going to tell you is ID selector. And you must have guessed it as soon as you heard the ID selector. Let us say I want the hashtag red ID. Or let's do one thing, let's make an ID with the name hashtag green. And if I write here background color green, then wherever I will give ID green, it will be green. Now here you can see that our I am another div. It has no color, no background color. But as soon as I give it ID green, I will show you. I will write here, I will give ID to this. Green and you can see that I have given background color green in the name green. Its background color will be green. So this is our ID selector. It was very simple, right? Yes, it is simple. We make things simple here. Now I will tell you what is child selector. And the source code will do the work of these notes. So what is child selector? If I want the paragraph in the div to be blue, then I say that the color of the paragraph in the div should be blue. And what should be the background color? The background color should be brown. Let's say I want this. If I put a paragraph in any div, I am a para inside div. So what will happen? This selector will be applied. Child selector. Because this is the child of div. This paragraph is the child of div. And I have said that if any paragraph of div is child, then what will happen? Then its background will be brown. And the color will be blue. As simple as that. Now I will show you one thing. If I wrap this whole thing in a div. Actually I will span it. I will not do div. I will put it in the main or some other element. Let's say I use article tag here. So now this paragraph is not in the div. Now if this paragraph is inside the div or article, then this property will not be applied. I will show you. Now this property is not applied. Because this selector means that if it is directly inside the div, then what will happen? This selector will be applied or not. Here this direct child is not there. There is an article inside the div. Then there is a p. This is not the direct child of div. But if I want that if the paragraph is a descendant of any div, then this property will be applied. Then what will I do? Then I have another way. I will show you. I will use descendant selector. And what is descendant selector? Descendant selector is simply we write something like this. I will write div, then I will write a space and then p. I am saying that p should be inside the div. No matter who it is. Whether it is inside the div, article, main, footer. Whatever is inside the footer, p should be inside the div. In some form. Then it should be applied. It should be a descendant of div. So you see here that this property is now applied again. But when I talk about child selector, then child selector should be a direct child. Then it will be applied. I hope all these things are making sense to you. Now after this, there is another universal selector. It means that I want to give all the elements a margin of 0. And I want to give padding of 0. If I write p0, then through emmet, I can write padding 0. It means that all the elements have a margin of 0 and padding of 0. See, everything is stuck here. Earlier there was margin and padding, which was given by default by Google Chrome. But now this margin and padding is over. As you have just seen. I hope you have understood this thing. Now see, there are many other types of selectors. But these are the most used selectors. Now I will tell you about more selectors in the coming videos. But these are the ones with which we will do our web development. So I don't want to confuse you more. And you guys may not be able to learn these main selectors. So I want you to pay attention to this first. This is the most important. Through this, 99% of the websites are made. So let's focus on this only. I hope you have understood this thing. And you have understood it very well. There is one more selector, which is also important. I will tell you that. And what is its name? Pseudo selectors. Now what is this pseudo selector? I have a link. I will write it here. I will write universal selector. Universal selector. Ok. Universal selector. What is this? Why is the comment not appearing? Now what I will do here? I will write pseudo. Pseudo. Yes, I know. It is called pseudo. Don't write in the comment. It is not pseudo, it is pseudo. It is not pneumonia, it is pneumonia. I know that P is silent here. So why did you put it silent? Tell me in the comment section. Tell me in the comment section. Whoever has the knowledge of this. But now I will share the knowledge with you. And that is pseudo selectors. Now assume I have a link. I have a link. LINK. Now I will write here. https://www.google.com And I will write here. Go to Google. And It is very good. You will go to Google and you will ask what was new in it. I want its color to be Let us say white. No, I will not keep white. Let it be yellow. So I want A visited to be A visited What should its color be? Its color should be yellow. So let's say I make the color yellow. Its color will be yellow. So if I want the anchor text to be Yellow after being visited. Then I can use the pseudo selector. So here you can see Its color changing. After this if you link a colon. That is the link Which has not been visited. And let's say you want its color to be green. So whatever link I put. What will be its color? Let's say I do it like this. Go to Facebook. Let's capitalize the G of Google. Will its color be green? No, its color will not be green. I have already visited Google. So I have to write Facebook here too. Okay So I will write it on Facebook. What will happen if I do Facebook 2? Yes, if I do Facebook 2, then see this. I have not visited it. I have visited Facebook.com. If you remember, then in the initial few lectures. So that's why it is showing like this. Now I tell you about two more selectors. One is A-active. And I tell you that if you type any type of pseudo selector. Then it shows you in the suggestion. Now if I want. That the background color of A-active should be red. So as soon as I click on any link. You see its background color is red. So active means when you are clicking. So see here, it is going to google.com. And as soon as I click, its background will be red. Yes, I know that ideally you will not want to use. Background color red. But that was just an example. To show you how it happens. The main idea is to make the background color red. Because you will know this directly. Now after this, what else do we have? Apart from anchor tag. Some pseudo selectors. The answer is yes. One is hover. If I want to hover on anchor tag. And I want. That its background color should be red. Or the background color should be yellow. I make its background color yellow. So if I hover, then you can see here. That its background color is yellow. So I have written a hover here. And the background color is yellow. So these were some pseudo selectors. Now I will tell you one more pseudo selector. And that will be. If I want. That I have a div. Whose class is selector. And I will write. I am selector. Here I will do one thing. I will put its name as one. So here I will tell you. About first child pseudo selector. This may seem a little tricky to you. And whatever I am telling you. These are pseudo selectors. So this pseudo selector. If I write here. That its background color should be aqua. It means that wherever P is. The first child of its parent. There its background color will be aqua. Like in this case you can see. I have put a main tag here. And here it is written. P I am first. And here you can see. Because here it is. P is the first child of its parent. So this class will be applied in this. So you see. Here its background color is aqua. But I will tell you again. That these things are very little used. When you do web development. So you guys are pseudo classes like this. Do more research about them. What I will do in the description. I will put links about such things. So the additional reading material. If you want to see more pseudo classes. You will get the link in the description. Maybe I will put it in the pinned comment. And if I forget. Then you can remind me. So I will give all the links to you. From there you can read about such selectors. But now we will move forward in this course. And we will read about the main things. Because we have to come on projects very soon. And make good real world apps. And after that we have to do back end. We have to do database. So we have to build a little pace here.
