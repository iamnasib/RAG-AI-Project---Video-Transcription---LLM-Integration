And they will rank our website on Google, Bing, and their respective search engines. And we want the crawlers to understand our website. And we want whoever wants to understand our website to understand it well. That's why there are some special tags like header, nav, main, article, figure. All these special tags are made in HTML, which help you to structure your website. Now if there is something in the header, then I know that it is header, that is, it is at the top. If there is something in the footer, then I will understand that the website has started ending from here. This footer started here. This footer could have been div, but no. If I am using Semantic HTML, then I will use the footer tag. Along with that, where I was making my navigation bar in the span tag, this time I will not make my navigation bar in the span tag, I will make my navigation bar in the nav tag. So these kinds of differences explain our search engines very well about what our website is about. So I will show you some examples of semantic tags here. And I hope you understood what semantic tags are. Now see, there are download folders like our computer. Like many people's download folder is like that, I don't know, all the files of the world have come in it. 90% of the files of your computer are in the download folder of many people. But we should not do this. Some people go to such an extent that they start spreading files in their local disk C, in the windows folder. And some people keep files in system 32 too, friends. So if you spread your files in your entire computer, then definitely it is not arranged in one way. If you arrange it in folders, that you have this file in one folder. If you want to put a secret file in a folder, you put secret files. You can make a folder, do not open disk name. If you can put some of your files in it, then it will be arranged in one way. You have arranged images on one side, you have arranged videos on one side, and let's say you have arranged e-books on one side. So whenever you go to find it, you will get it. So it will be much better for you to understand that folder structure. Instead of you spreading your files throughout the computer. You definitely do not want to spread your files throughout the computer. So I hope you understand why we use semantic tags. This is very good for our SEO. So SEO is a word, I have not used it yet. But SEO is a very important part of search engine optimization. Using semantic tags. So what happens? Basically, I make your website the way you make it. You just use some special tags. For example, let's say I am making this website. What I will do now is comment out this image. What are semantic tags? I will not comment it out. What I will do here is basically make a navbar. So what I will do? First of all, I will say that this is the header of my website. I have used a header tag. I will make a nav in it. In this, I will make an unordered list. I will make an li in it. And I will write home here. And after that, let's say I am writing a lot like this. And this is my header like this. So anyone who comes to my website will understand that this is my header. Home, about, contact, whatever I want to write. I can write it here. So this is my header, this is my navbar. This is clearly visible because I have used header and nav tags. So I write about here. And I write contact here. So here I wrote home, here I wrote about, and here I wrote contact. So I hope you understood this thing. Now if I want a footer, let's say I want to make a footer. And my main content will come after the header. So I will use the main tag. And after that, my footer, let's say I write in the footer. Copyright, CWH, and here I write all rights reserved. Okay, I can write like this. So here, see, copyright, all rights reserved, I wrote all this here. Did I, yes, so what I will do is I will cut this. I will put it in the main. This is my main content. So first my header will come, then the main content will come, then the footer will come. As you can see here. And here too, you see, here is the header, this is my main content, this is the footer. So in one way, what I did is I arranged it. In the same way, the way you arrange your files in different folders, I arranged my HTML tags here. So we understood about the header tag that it is used to represent the top section of a webpage. Which is the header. Then after this, we will put the nav, which is in the navigation menu on our page, in the nav tag. Ideally, the article indicates a self-containing piece of content such as blog post or news article. If you put a particular self-contained piece of content, then put it in the article tag. Section represents a thematic grouping. That is, suppose one section is talking about one thing on your page. Then the second section will talk about something else. Aside, aside means if anything is lying on the side, then it is used as an aside tag. Here see, typically used for sidebars or content that is tangentially related to the main content. Like what you can do on the aside tag is that you have to put a side note, you have to put about the author. You must have seen a lot of blogs in which the side is also written about the author. So you can put such things in the aside tag. Then after this we have the footer tag, I told you about it. If you want to put copyright information or if you want to put some important links of the website, then you can put that in the footer. Then after this, figure and fig caption. What is figure and fig caption? Whenever you want to use images, diagrams, charts, you can use figure and fig captions. The main content area inside the main, like the main content area of our page was that we put it in the main tag. Then there is also a time tag, used to represent time-related information. So you can use the time tag, you can put date, time or anything in it. So I hope you understand this thing now. So these are used to enhance SEO, to improve accessibility. And if browsers want to take a decision about any of our pages, let's say there is a browser, it has a new feature that it will read our content aloud. Like there is a feature in Edge. So the browser can decide that I am only reading the main content. Now think about it, if someone wants to read this page aloud, then how will he read it aloud? Code with Harry, Home, Courses, Tutorial. You don't want to read aloud like this. You want to read the main content, HTML, Semantic Tags, HTML5 Introduce, Arrange, Semantic Tags and so on. The first versions of our HTML did not have semantic tags. Semantic tags were introduced from HTML5. And the most important reason to introduce semantic tags in HTML5 is to arrange things. So that the browsers or whoever is parsing the content, whoever is looking at the code of our content, whether it is a browser, crawler, google, bing, search engines, or if anyone wants to generate a preview, like if you put a URL on Twitter, or if you want to generate a preview, if there are such things, then you will want your content to be understood properly. So if you want your content to be understood properly, then you will use semantic tags. Here this image is explaining very well that if you write HTML without semantic tags, then you will write semantic tags like this. This image you are seeing, this is a header, this is a nav, this is a side. How to throw one thing in the side, we will do all this with CSS. Don't be confused, this is not used for styling. Because many people are confused that it is not used to assign things. No, it is not at all. You will have to style things with CSS, but here your content can be understood properly. Describe which is the main content, which is the header or footer. That's why semantic tags were made. So semantic tags do not do any magic. Semantic tags were made only for accessibility and to understand your page. Now here are some examples that you can see. I have given the example of header and footer tag. What will happen inside the header? Here you see that you will ideally put your navigation bar inside the header. And then you will style it with CSS. I will show you a very quick styling. Obviously, we will talk about styling later. But many people must be confused about how this navigation bar will be horizontal. So if you want to make the navigation bar horizontal, then I will write some CSS here. And I will tell you all this, why does CSS work here. So you see, I have flexed the display, so it happened like this. So a lot is going to happen in the coming videos. So don't worry about this at all. We didn't do this, we didn't do that. I will tell you everything. And what does it mean that I wrote CSS here? Why did I write CSS by inspecting? I will tell you about this too. I will reload, it went away. Why did it go away? We are going to see all this in the CSS section. If you have not accessed this playlist yet, then do it. Bookmark the accesses. Click here and save it. And I am uploading all the code. So as you move forward in the videos, you will get all the code here video wise. Do start this repository if you have not done it yet. And like the video along with it. Thank you so much guys for watching this video. And I will see you next time. Outro Music."
